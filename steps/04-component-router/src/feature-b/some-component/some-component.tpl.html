<div class="jumbotron">
    <h1>Feature B!</h1>
    <h2>Feature B is implemented as Angular 2 component</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Feature is so great that it even contains counter functionality! It also contains: {{property}}</p>
    <p>Counter: <strong>{{count}}</strong></p>
    <p>Oh, and don't forget about <code>user-info-component</code> which we just reused here... Sick! <user-info-component></user-info-component></p>

    <button class="btn btn-success" (click)="increment()">Increment counter</button>
    <button class="btn btn-info" [routerLink]="['FeatureA']">Try Feature A</button>
</div>
